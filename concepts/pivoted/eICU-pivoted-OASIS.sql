-- Title: Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS)
-- This query extracts the Oxford acute severity of illness score.
-- This score is a measure of severity of illness for patients in the ICU.
-- The score is calculated on the first day of each ICU patients' stay.
-- OASIS score was originally created for MIMIC
-- This script creates a pivoted table containing the OASIS score in eICU

-- Variables used in OASIS (first 24h only):
--  Heart rate, MAP, Temperature, Respiratory rate
--  (sourced FROM `physionet-data.eicu_crd_derived.pivoted_vital`)
--  GCS
--  (sourced FROM `physionet-data.eicu_crd_derived.pivoted_vital` and `physionet-data.eicu_crd_derived.physicalexam`)
--  Urine output 
--  (sourced  FROM `physionet-data.eicu_crd_derived.pivoted_uo`)
--  Pre-ICU in-hospital length of stay 
--  (sourced FROM `physionet-data.eicu_crd.patient`)
--  Age 
--  (sourced FROM `physionet-data.eicu_crd.patient`)
--  Elective surgery 
--  (sourced FROM `physionet-data.eicu_crd.patient` and `physionet-data.eicu_crd.apachepredvar`)
--  Ventilation status 
--  (sourced FROM `physionet-data.eicu_crd_derived.ventilation_events`, `physionet-data.eicu_crd.apacheapsvar`, 
--   `physionet-data.eicu_crd.apachepredvar`, and `physionet-data.eicu_crd.respiratorycare`)

-- Regarding missing values:
-- Elective stay: If there is no information on surgery in an elective stay, we assumed all cases to be -> "no elective surgery"
-- There are a lot of missing values, especially for urine output. Hence, we have created 2 OASIS summary scores:
-- 1) No imputation, values as is with missings. 2) Imputation in case of NULL values, with 0's (common approach for severity of illness scores)

-- Note:
--  The score is calculated for *all* ICU patients, with the assumption that the user will subselect appropriate patientunitstayid.
